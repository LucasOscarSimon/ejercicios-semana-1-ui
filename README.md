# Android Kotlin Exercises - Class 1

This repository contains solutions to practical exercises from **Class 1** of an Android with Kotlin course.

The exercises focus on practicing Kotlin language fundamentals, including:

- Variable declarations using `val` and `var`
- Data types (`Int`, `Double`, `String`, `Boolean`)
- Built-in functions like `toString()`, `toInt()`, `Integer.toBinaryString()`
- Arithmetic and logical operators
- String concatenation
- Basic control structures (sorting, comparisons)

## 🧠 Objective

Get familiar with basic Kotlin syntax in an Android environment using Jetpack Compose to build a simple interface that incorporates some of the exercises.
